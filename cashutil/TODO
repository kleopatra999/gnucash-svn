The shell is incomplete. The Doxygen output contains
the list of todo items for completion. To build the docs:
cd doc
make doc
Build the rest of the tree first, using:
./autogen.sh --with-qof=<QOF location> --prefix=<cashutil prefix>

The website template needs extending but keep to a GnuCash style.

gncCommodity is the biggest problem outstanding. Until
this is overhauled to be a genuine QOF object, currencies
and probably stocks will be off-limits.

Later, the GnuCash v2 XML backend will be linked to CashUtil
in preparation for full inclusion into the GnuCash tree and the
completed spin-out of QOF (which will have an interim location
of lib/qof/ in the GnuCash source tree while remaining issues
are being resolved.
