CashUtil source readme
======================

CashUtil is intended to be built separately from
GnuCash whilst being developed in the same CVS tree.

The modifications within GnuCash mean that the object
files and the backend files need to be reorganised. 
Also, the translation files, man page and configuration
scripts are just for CashUtil.

CashUtil also uses QOF as an external library, requiring
libqof1 (>= 0.6.0).

A lot of the translatable strings are similar to GnuCash
but have to be formatted slightly differently for a command
line interface.

Important: When debugging this code, remember that CashUtil
is linked against an installed version of QOF, AND it *only*
uses the installed copies of libcashobjects.la and 
libgnc-backend-file.la. You must 'make install' to test any
changes in the source files for these libraries. If you
change any QOF files, run 'make install' in QOF and then
run 'make install' in CashUtil.

If you have your own books to test during development, CVS 
will ignore a src/books directory as a convenience.
