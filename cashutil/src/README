CashUtil source readme
======================

CashUtil is intended to be built separately from
GnuCash whilst being developed in the same SVN tree.

The modifications within GnuCash mean that the libraries
built from the object files and the backend files need 
to be renamed and reorganised.

Also, the translation files, man page and configuration
scripts in gnucash/cashutil are just for CashUtil.

CashUtil is built to use QOF as an external library, requiring
libqof1 (>= 0.6.0) - the internal libqof in gnucash can also
be used.

A lot of the translatable strings are similar to GnuCash
but have to be formatted slightly differently for a command
line interface.

CashUtil uses the *installed* versions of these GModules
that are shared with gnucash:
      libgnc-backend-file.la
      libgnc-backend-bus.la
When debugging cashutil, remember that if you change files
in src/backend/file and/or src/business/business-core/file,
run `make install` in src/backend/file and/or
src/business/business-core/file before testing your changes
in cashutil!

CashUtil also shares these libraries with gnucash:
      libcashobjects.la
      libcashbusobjects.la
These are linked 'in-situ' so a `make` is sufficient.
