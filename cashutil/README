CASHUTIL - Command line GnuCash.
========

Most of the QOF processing is done in qof-main.c - the 
specifics of making this general template into CashUtil are 
expressed in cashutil.c which simply loads the particular 
objects for this program and provides main().

1.  CashUtil uses QSF XML which can be exported
    from GnuCash v2 - the Gnome2 port which is
    due for release in late 2005.

2.  CashUtil will concentrate on the business
    objects, gncInvoice, gncCustomer etc.
    There are problems with currencies that mean
    support is delayed.

3.  CashUtil is now being steered towards full inclusion
    in the GnuCash G2 source tree and using the full 
    functionality of the GnuCash objects. 

4.  The development of CashUtil is feeding back into
    GnuCash in the separation of the financial objects
    into a shared library, together with ancillary
    logic from the GnuCash UI.

5.  CashUtil will also now link into the GnuCash v2 XML
    backend to read existing user data files as well as
    exported data.
 
CashUtil needs QOF v0.6.0 (currently available at v0.6.0  
and via CVS) - it can use the gnucash internal libqof.

-# Replace the list of object header files in cashutil.c

-# Change the version numbers and name of the program in 
configure.ac AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(cashutil, [$VERSION]),
