/** @mainpage CashUtil

CashUtil is the command line interface for GnuCash - intended to provide
full access to as many GnuCash features as can be implemented in a command
line environment. CashUtil supports SQL-type queries and writing results to
QSF XML to support external report scripts / tools. It also includes the 
prototype QOF interactive shell and limited undo capability.

QOF is Query Object Framework, an established abstraction layer in C that
enables queries and interchange of complex data - spun-out from GnuCash.
QSF is the XML file backend for QOF, newly written for this project but using
a backend framework already in use in GnuCash.

QOF v0.6.0 is required for CashUtil.
