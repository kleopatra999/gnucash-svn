This is a ad-hoc list of list of what works and doesn't work in the g2
port of gnucash.  The plan is to finish porting those parts of gnucash
that have already been started (i.e. new windowing system, account
tree, commodities tree, etc.), but not to port any additional features
unless absolutely required.  The clist/ctree widgets *do* still exist
in gtk2 and can be used, even though they've been marked as deprecated
and will disappear in a future release.  Its important to get this
release out the door and not stall it until all the deprecated
functionality has been removed.

Feel free to add to, delete from, or modify anything in this list.  If
someone wants to turn this into a columnar table with a field for
names of active developers, that'd be great.

            General Notes
========================================

Account Tree: - FUNCTIONAL

	- can open/close multiple account tree windows
	- can navigate account tree
	- select an account and run a command
	- Some menu/toolbar items functional


Register Core - MINIMALLY FUNCTIONAL

	- Can navigate, enter transactions, etc.

	- Insertion point not shown. (fix gnucash-item-edit.c)
	- Cannot hilight text with mouse (fix gnucash-item-edit.c)
	- Popup buttons don't appear. (gnucash-item-edit.c ?)

	- The first time it is used, the account popup immediately
	  selects the first account. After that it functions normally.


Price Editor - MINIMALLY FUNCTIONAL

	- Only loads one commodity
	- Doesn't notice a new commodity, but adds another line from
	  existing commodities.
	- Remove/Edit doesn't work
	- Get Quotes works.
	- Close doesn't work.

Stock Split Dialog - Mostly done
	-Fix up accounts presented on "Cash In Lieu" page.  Always
	shows top two levels.

Find - MINIMALLY FUNCTIONAL
	- Can generate a query in the dialog.
	- Use of the "Date" selection sometimes crashes gnucash (not
	  when you select it, but then you change from "Date" to
	  something else.

View Summarybar - Summarybar not ported yet. Where should it go?
	Wouldn't look good between the toolbar and the notebook tabs.

Business functions - Somewhat Functional
	- Everything works but the New Invoice/Bill code.  The dialog
	seems to function properly but then gnucash crashes when the
	dialog is closed.

IMPORTING

  HBCI - Needs new http support.

========================================
              ENHANCEMENTS
========================================

1) New icons desired:

	a) Add account
	b) Register
	c) Report

2) Support a preference on whether new plugin pages appear in the same
	or a new window.

3) Enhance Commodity Editor by converting to a tree so types can be
	expanded/collapsed to find data easier

4) Make account tree columns clickable. Provide in-place editing where
	feasable.  E.G. Editing the account code or the account name, but
	not being able to reparent the account.  (Maybe add DND support for
	this in the long term?)
