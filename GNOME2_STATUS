This is a ad-hoc list of list of what works and doesn't work in the g2
port of gnucash.  The plan is to finish porting those parts of gnucash
that have already been started (i.e. new windowing system, account
tree, commodities tree, etc.), but not to port any additional features
unless absolutely required.  The clist/ctree widgets *do* still exist
in gtk2 and can be used, even though they've been marked as deprecated
and will disappear in a future release.  Its important to get this
release out the door and not stall it until all the deprecated
functionality has been removed.

Feel free to add to, delete from, or modify anything in this list.  If
someone wants to turn this into a columnar table with a field for
names of active developers, that'd be great.
