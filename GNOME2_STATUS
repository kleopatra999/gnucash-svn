This is a ad-hoc list of list of what works and doesn't work in the g2
port of gnucash.  The plan is to finish porting those parts of gnucash
that have already been started (i.e. new windowing system, account
tree, commodities tree, etc.), but not to port any additional features
unless absolutely required.  The clist/ctree widgets *do* still exist
in gtk2 and can be used, even though they've been marked as deprecated
and will disappear in a future release.  Its important to get this
release out the door and not stall it until all the deprecated
functionality has been removed.

Feel free to add to, delete from, or modify anything in this list.  If
someone wants to turn this into a columnar table with a field for
names of active developers, that'd be great.

========================================
             STATUS / TO DO
========================================

Main Window

	- hbci functions missing from menus
	- report functions missing from menus
	
Account Tree: - FUNCTIONAL

	- can open/close multiple account tree windows
	- can navigate account tree
	- select an account and run a command
	- Some menu/toolbar items functional

	- Account tree doesn't open automatically
	- importing qif produces errors


Register Core - MINIMALLY FUNCTIONAL

	- All widgets visible
	- Popup widgets work

	- Cannot enter data
	- The first time it is used, the account popup immediately
	  selects the first account. After that it functions normally.

	"There's a nasty bug in the register code related to gnucash's
	use of an off-screen gtkentry to do text manipulation.  g2
	doesn't allow this, and I ran out of patience trying to fix
	the problem and moved on to the account tree model/view.  At
	some point, either I or someone else need sot go back and fix
	this so the register isn't a read-only mechanism.  Hopefully
	its a simple fix, and I didn't see it.  Other than this one
	issue, the rest of the register works, as far as I can tell."

Financial Calculator - WORKING

Price Editor - MINIMALLY FUNCTIONAL

	- Only loads one commodity
	- Doesn't notice a new commodity, but adds another line from
	  existing commodities.
	- Remove/Edit doesn't work
	- Get Quotes works.
	- Close doesn't work.

Commodity Editor - WORKING

	- Enhance by converting to a tree so types can be
	expanded/collapsed to find data easier

Reconcile - APPEARS TO WORK

Transfer - APPEARS TO WORK

Stock Split Dialog - Mostly done
	-Fix up accounts presented on "Cash In Lieu" page.  Always
	shows top two levels.

Find - MINIMALLY FUNCTIONAL
	- Can generate a query in the dialog.
	- Use of the "Date" selection sometimes crashes gnucash (not
	  when you select it, but then you change from "Date" to
	  something else.
	- Clicking find or help crashes gnucash. (Not a problem with
	  find. A problem with the code it calls.)


View Toolbar/Summarybar/Statusbar - NEEDS WORK
