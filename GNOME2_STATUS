This is a ad-hoc list of list of what works and doesn't work in the g2
port of gnucash.  The plan is to finish porting those parts of gnucash
that have already been started (i.e. new windowing system, account
tree, commodities tree, etc.), but not to port any additional features
unless absolutely required.  The clist/ctree widgets *do* still exist
in gtk2 and can be used, even though they've been marked as deprecated
and will disappear in a future release.  Its important to get this
release out the door and not stall it until all the deprecated
functionality has been removed.

Feel free to add to, delete from, or modify anything in this list.  If
someone wants to turn this into a columnar table with a field for
names of active developers, that'd be great.

            General Notes
========================================

Main Window
        - New registers should open in new top-level windows.


Register Core - MOSTLY FUNCTIONAL

	- Can navigate, enter transactions, etc.

	- Insertion point not shown. (fix gnucash-item-edit.c)
	- <strike>Cannot hilight text with mouse (fix gnucash-item-edit.c)</strike>
          - Getting better; x-position -> pango-text-index works; some gtk_entry selection works.
          - Offset for non-LEFT_ALIGN'ed fields not correct.
          - finer points of gtk_entry selection+position setting not correct, yet.

	- The first time it is used, the account popup immediately
	  selects the first account. After that it functions normally.

        - The drop-down-arrow widgets for {date,action,account-sel} don't seem to be showing.

Find - Somewhat Functional
	- Can generate a query in the dialog.

View Summarybar - Summarybar not ported yet. Where should it go?
	Wouldn't look good between the toolbar and the notebook tabs.

Business functions - Somewhat Functional
	- Everything works but the New Invoice/Bill code.  The dialog
          seems to function properly but then gnucash crashes when the
          dialog is closed.
        - The dialog-invoice.c needs to switch over to using GtkActions /
          menu-merging so that it can call
          gnc_extensions_menu_setup( GtkWindow, char*, EggMenuMerge )

Reporting - Somewhat functional
        - Graphing still unsupported; [jsled] in periodic contact with Jody
          Goldberg of Gnumeric regarding Gnome Office Graphing [GOG] to be
          factored out of gnumeric into libgoffice.

        - Save/restore in unknown state; believed to crash on re-start.

IMPORTING

  HBCI - Needs new http support. [gnet]

Budgeting
    - Can create/modify budgets via the Budgeting workbench.
      (Actions->Budgeting Workbench)
    - Track budget tab still needs to be competed.  Should allow you to look
      at predicted vs actual information.
    - No save to file functionality.  Therefore budgets must currently be
      created fresh each time gnucash is started.  First thing that I want
      to fix.
    - Should the budgeting workbench fit into the new windowing scheme
      better?  Currently it is its own window but maybe each workbench
      should be a tab in the new layout.  How would this work with the
      sub-tabs?  Have to think about this some more.
    - Probably more TODO but these are the main points.

========================================
              ENHANCEMENTS
========================================

1)	New icons desired:

	a) Add account
	b) Register
	c) Report
           * Report options, especially.

2)	Support a preference on whether new plugin pages appear in the
	same or a new window.
        * We definitely want register windows to appear in new top-levels.
        * Reporting windows should probably appear in the top-level they were
          created from.


3)      Provide in-place editing where feasable.  E.G. Editing the
	account code or the account name, but not being able to
	reparent the account.  (Maybe add DND support for this in the
	long term?)

4/      Print-preview support.
