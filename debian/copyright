	This software is Free Software. Please refer to the file
	COPYING, which you should have received together this file and the
	source code of the combo box widget.  However if you find this
	widget to be usefull, you are encouraged to donate a reasonable
	amount to a charitable institution -- there are enough people
	out there who need help! Sometimes I got the strong impression
	that programmers tend to get lost in their own "virtual reality"
	- sitting in front of their screen, hacking new algorithms and
	forget about everything around them.  So please don't forget
	about people who need help.
