This directory contains spec files for building an RPM

Short instructions:

You'll need to be root.  (It is possible to avoid this requirement,
but I haven't done the work to the RPM.)

cp gnucash-x.x.x.tar.gz /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
cp gnucash.spec /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
cd /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
cd /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
rpm -ba gnucash.spec

wait a bit, and a new binary rpm will be in
/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/<arch> and a new src.rpm will be in
/usr/src/redhat/SRPMS.

There is also an alternative spec file to build gnucash with sql support. If
you want this just use gnucash-sql.spec instead of the normal one.
