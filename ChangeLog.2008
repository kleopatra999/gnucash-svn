	  #348860: Fix missing sub-report options when saving a

	  too. This is important for saving multicolumn reports. Patch by

	* [r17761] src/register/register-gnome/gnucash-sheet.c,
	  src/register/register-gnome/gnucash-style.c: [17747] Bug
	  #563273: Fix crash on startup Here's the problem... GnuCash uses
	  a hash table with int keys to store dimensions, and the key
	  value is the number of rows in the dimension being stored. The
	  problem is that this key value is stored in a static int inside
	  the style_get_key function, which means that the key always has
	  the same address, and the hash functions in glib2 store the
	  *address*, not the *value* of the key. Unfortunately, the hash
	  algorithm changed some time between glib2-2.18.2 and
	  glib2-2.19.2, such that there's a hash conflict between the key
	  value 1 and the key value 2, but since the value of the already
	  hashed key was swiped out from under it when style_get_key
	  "created" a new key, the hash table entry that's already there
	  matches even when it shouldn't have. The attached patch cleans
	  this up by allocating memory to hold the key when inserting it
	  into the hash table. It also changes the way the hash table is
	  created to ensure that the memory is freed when a hash table
	  entry or hash table is destroyed. And while I was at it, I made
	  the same fix for the cursors hash table, which was also leaking
	  memory when entries were removed or the table was destroyed.
	  Patch by Jonathan Kamens.

	  #436342: Make the register keep track of whether the exchange
	  rate has been reset. This prevents a zero exchange rate from
	  being ambiguous: previously the register could not tell the
	  difference between "the user has not specified an exchange rate"
	  and "the user has specified a rate of zero". Much of this patch
	  consists of new ENTER(), DEBUG() and LEAVE() calls for
	  debugging. Nearly all of the rest is refactoring. The code that
	  detected and acted on changes to the account cell has been
	  placed into its own function,
	  gnc_split_register_check_account(). The several calls needed to
	  checking a cell for changes have been combined in
	  gnc_split_register_check_cell(). About 15 lines represent actual
	  changes in functionality. Specifically, the code does a better
	  job of recognizing when an exchange rate needs to be requested
	  from the user, and when it does not. When an account cell is
	  changed in the register, and the new account is denominated in
	  the same commodity as the original, the original exchange rate
	  is used. On the other hand, if the commodity differs, the rate
	  is reset to zero. The register remembers that the zero exchange
	  rate is due to the reset (i.e. was not user-entered) so that the
	  the exchange rate dialog can be presented. Finally, the cell
	  contents are checked before doing a save; previously the checks
	  were missed in certain cases, e.g. if the user pressed "Enter"
	  or clicked the close button. Original commit by cedayiv.

	  files using G_LOCK. See
	  http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=316221 for information
	  why G_LOCK breaks strict-aliasing. GCC 4.2 introduced diagnostic
	  pragmas and the error seems to be most prominent on GCC >= 4.3,
	  so a compilation with -Werror should succeed now on most
	  systems, at least on those it worked on before.
	* [r17569] src/import-export/aqbanking/gnc-ab-utils.c: [r17566]
	  Add a variable initialization to bal_accountinfo_cb(). That

	  gnc_numeric_to_decimal(). Committed by cedayiv.
	* [r17559] src/gnome-utils/gnc-amount-edit.c: [r17553]
	  GNCAmountEdit: Put the text through the expression parser once
	  instead of twice. This caused a problem in locales that print
	  negative numbers in parentheses. For example, if you entered
	  "-4/3", after the first parse the displayed text would change to
	  "(1 + 1/3)", meaning negative one and one-third. Parsing that
	  text a second time changes the text to "1 + 1/3" since, to the
	  expression parser, parentheses indicate grouping rather than
	  sign. The reason the GNCAmountEdit was putting the text through
	  the parser twice was that it was setting gae->need_to_parse
	  FALSE, but then immediately calling gtk_entry_set_text(), which
	  issues a "changed" signal. The callback for that signal was
	  setting gae->need_to_parse back to TRUE. So I simply changed the
	  order of the statements.
	* [r17558] src/gnome-utils/gnc-tree-view-commodity.c,
	  src/gnome-utils/gnc-tree-view-price.c: [r17349,17468,17535] In
	  price and commodity tree views, restore gconf settings after
	  initialization, add default sort column. Previously, gconf
	  settings like sort column and order for price and commodity
	  dialogs were read in while creating the main tree view objects
	  themselves, i.e. before a model has been set. In this early
	  stage of initialization, these properties cannot always be set
	  and are ignored subsequently. Instead, apply the properties
	  after the view has been built. Set a default sorting column if
	  no column has been found in gconf. Committed by cedayiv and
	  andi5.

	* [r17550] src/backend/file/gnc-backend-file.c: [r17524] Bug

	  return value of link(2) on files residing on sshfs will be

	* [r17548] src/import-export/aqbanking/gnc-ab-transfer.c: [r17502]
	  Treat AB_Job_StatusPending as a good status, do not ask the user
	  to repeat. According to Martin Preuss a lot of banks set the
	  status of a transaction job to pending, signifying that they
	  accepted the job but have not yet executed it. This also means
	  that we cannot detect whether the account is actually
	  overdrafted. Instead, ignore the return value of
	  AB_Banking_ExecuteJobs() (it will almost always be 0) and only
	  check the job's status against AB_Job_StatusFinished and
	  AB_Job_StatusPending. If the status is different, ask the user
	  whether he wants to repeat, as usual.

	  [r17035] Bug #514027: Fix QIF importer druid so that commodities
	  pages are not skipped. Do not skip them if the user goes back to
	  the currency page. Create additional commodity pages if the user
	  goes back and loads additional QIF files with new securities.

	  Improve the way the QIF importer handles Scheme exceptions.
	  Those may occur during conversion of QIF data into GnuCash data.
	  If an exception occurs, the druid now displays a cancellation
	  page instead of a pop up message. In addition to avoiding taking
	  the user to an empty duplicate checking window, the new page
	  could, in the future, be extended to show multiple, specific

	  Previously, gtk_widget_show_all() and gtk_widget_hide() were
	  called on the dialog, so that everything except the dialog
	  widget itself were set visible. That way the user did not see
	  the dialog filling up and resizing on initialization. Buggy
	  window managers do not like subsequent map&unmaps though and do
	  not make the search dialog pop up correctly. This change removes
	  both calls and depends on the interesting subwidgets being
	  visible. For search.glade and the widgets inside dialog-search.c
	  this is guaranteed now. Approved by andrewsw.

	  subsequent attempts to access the options to fail and crash. A

	  Fix the rounding of security transactions in the QIF Importer
	  (#373584). The QIF file does not provide the total amount paid

	  POTFILES.in is no longer generated automatically during make
	  dist, but only on explicit "make pot", because the build rule
	  will now modify POTFILES.in in the srcdir and no longer in the
