      TXF Export Report</h1>
    
    <a href="xacc-txf-export-example.html"><img SRC="image/report-txf.png"

    <p>This report allows you to export all tax related Income and Expenses
      to a TXF (Tax eXchange Format) file that can be imported into tax
      filing programs such as TaxCut or TurboTax.
    </p>
    <p><b>NOTE:</b> For this to work, the user has to segregate taxable and
      not taxable income to different accounts, as well as deductible
      and non deductible expenses. The user also must Set the TXF category
      of each tax related account.  The "Txf Export Init" tab on the
      parameter dialog allows this.  It is best to set this up from the
      Tax Report before actually running this report.  Otherwise, you
      will just get an empty file.  There is a taxreport.xac file in the
      examples directory, which shows one way this can be set up.
    </p>

    <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Most TXF codes should only appear on a single
      account!  The exceptions are codes preceded with "&lt;" or "^",
      which can appear many times.  Of course, each duplicate should
      have a unique payer name.  The current (1999) versions of TaxCut
      and TurboTax handle these duplicated codes differently.  TaxCut
      keeps the value of the last of the duplicates, while TurboTax sums
      all of the duplicates together.</p>

    <p>All of the parameters for the Tax Report still apply for the
      actual export.  Only the "Txf Export Init" parameters are described
      here.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The account(s) for which to set a TXF category.  If no
	account is selected nothing is changed.  If multiple accounts
	are selected, all of the Income accounts will be set to the
	selected item in the INCOME list box, and all of the Expense accounts
	will be set to the selected item in the EXPENSE list box.</li>
      <li>Print extended TXF HELP messages gives <a
	  href="xacc-txf-categories.html"> detailed descriptions </a>
	of each TXF category, instead of the usual tax report.</li>
      <li>INCOME TXF category selection (Select ONLY ONE!)</li>
      <li>TXF categories preceded with a "&lt;" or "^" export a payer
	name along with the value of the account.  This is usually the
	name of a bank, stock, or mutual fund that pays dividends or
	interest.  Occasionally, it is a description of a deduction.

	<br> On the report above, "Money Market Fund One" is an example
	of where the name of the current account is exported.  This is
	typically used when the fund pays only one type if income, such
	as interest.  For "Mutual Fund Four" and "Mutual Fund Five", the
	categories "Long Term Cap Gain" and "Dividend Income" both will
	export the name of the parent account.  This is typically used
	when the fund pays several different types of distributions.  As
	shown in this example, these funds have three types of
	distributions, but the "Income" and "Short Term Cap Gain"
	categories are totaled and exported together as "Dividend
	Income", as they are taxed the same.
	<ul>
	  <li>Default as indicated in the list box</li>
	  <li>&lt; Current Account</li>
	  <li>^ Parent Account</li>
	</ul></li>
      <li>EXPENSE TXF category selection (Select ONLY ONE!)</li>
    </ul>
