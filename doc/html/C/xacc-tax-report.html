    <p>This report allows you to view all tax related Income and Expenses.
      Up to fifteen sub-accounts are displayed. Lower sub-accounts are ignored.
    </p>
    <p><b>NOTE:</b> For this to work, the user has to segregate taxable and
      not taxable income to different accounts, as well as deductible
      and non deductible expenses. The user also must Set the Tax Status
      of each tax related account.  The "Set/Reset Tax Status:"
      parameter does this. There is a taxreport.xac file in the examples
      directory, which shows one way this can be set up.
    </p>
