    <h1>TXF Export - Known Anomalies and Limitations</h1>
    
    <p><b>TaxCut 1999</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Code: N488 "^ Sched B \ Div. income, cap gain distrib."<br>
	Code: N286 "^ Sched B \ Dividend income"</b><br>
	These two codes, from the same payer, are not correlated. The
	user will have to adjust for this after import.</li>
      <li><b>Code: N521 "  F1040 \ Federal estimated tax, qrtrly"</b><br>
      	Does not accept the date field and does not import the
	individual payment amounts, only the total. The date and
	individual payment amounts, only matter if you have to compute
	the penalty. (this may be a TurboTax enhancement)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>TurboTax 1999</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Code: N521 "  F1040 \ Federal estimated tax, qrtrly"</b><br>
      	Does not accept the dates outside of the tax year. This is a
	problem for the last payment that is due Jan 15.  GnuCash
	changes the the date of the last payment to Dec 31. The user
	will have to adjust for this after import. The date only matters
	if you have to compute the penalty.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>TXF Tax eXport Format</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Code: N460 "  W-2 \ Salary or wages, self"<br>
	  Code: N506 "  W-2 \ Salary or wages, spouse"</b><br>
	and other related codes.<br>
	Information from only one job may be imported. This is a
	limitation in the TXF spec.</li>

      <li><b>Duplicate Codes</b><br>
	Most codes are not supposed to appear more than once.  GnuCash
	issues an error message if it detects this, but will still
	export the data.  These are not handled the same by TaxCut and
	TurboTax.
	<ul>
	  <li><b>TurboTax</b><br>
	    Sums the duplicate codes. i.e., job one and job two are
	    added together.</li>
	  <li><b>TaxCut</b><br>
	    Keeps only the <b>LAST</b> of the duplicate codes. i.e., job
	    one is ignored and job two is kept.</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
