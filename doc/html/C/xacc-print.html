    <h1>Printing</h1>

    <p>At present, GnuCash does not support printing.  Check printing
       was supported temporarily, but had to be removed for the 1.4 release
       as the required libraries are not ready.  Support for printing 
       will return, much expanded,  in the 1.5.x development series.</p>
  
    <p><a href="xacc-reports.html">Reports</a> can be <a href=
    "xacc-reports.html#export">exported as HTML</a>, and the HTML can 
     be printed from Netscape or another web browser.</p>
