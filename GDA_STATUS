GDA backend status - Nov 7, 2006

Building:
- I am currently building with libgda 1.99.1 installed in /opt/libgda-1.99.1.
Configure.in will use pkg-config to set up the include and lib information.
This cannot be overridden (yet) by any switch on the ./configure command.

Execution:
- A basic GDA backend framework now exists.  This framework accepts URLs of
the form gda://DSN:USERNAME:PASSWORD.  "gda" is required.  "DSN" represents
a dataset configured in ~/.libgda/config.  USERNAME and PASSWORD are not
required but can be specified.

- The backend assumes that the database already exists.  Tables will be
created if they don't exist.  The ddl files in src/backend/gda/ddl are not
up to date.  Note that src/backend/gda/ddl/business.ddl has not been tried
yet, so there are no guarantees that any database will accept it.

- The backend will save commodities and load them on startup.

- The backend will save accounts and load them on startup.  Any information
in slots is not saved or loaded.

Functional Issues:
- In the price editor dialog, if you press Add, the dialog commits a price
with a NULL guid which is rejected by the db.

- Account information in slots is not saved or restored

- If you create a new account, the commodity with that account will be saved
to the db.  If you create a new price, the commodity with that price will not
be saved to the db if it doesn't already exist in the db.

- Transactions and splits are saved but not yet restored via query

GDA backend implementation issues:
- Should use GdaDataHandler for converting values -> SQL and getting values
back from the db.  Need to reassess this if using GdaQuery.

TODO:

- Better representation for gnc_numeric - doesn't compare well
- queries
	- transactions/splits
- SQLite if just a "file"
- handle construction of path name for nested slots
- lots
- sched transactions
- check for memory leaks
- add --with-libgda= configure option
- business objects
