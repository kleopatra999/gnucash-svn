GDA backend status - Nov 7, 2006

Building:
- I am currently building with libgda 1.99.1 installed in /opt/libgda-1.99.1.
This location is hard wired into src/backend/gda/Makefile.am as LIBGDA_DIR

Execution:
- A basic GDA backend framework now exists.  This framework accepts URLs of
the form gda://DSN:USERNAME:PASSWORD.  "gda" is required.  "DSN" represents
a dataset configured in ~/.libgda/config.  USERNAME and PASSWORD are not
required but can be specified.

- The backend assumes that the database already exists and tables are set up
according to src/backend/gda/ddl/gnucash.ddl.  Note that
src/backend/gda/ddl/business.ddl has not been tried yet, so there are no
guarantees that any database will accept it.

- The backend will save commodities and load them on startup.  However, they
will not have the correct GUIDs.

- The backend will save accounts and load them on startup.  Any information
in slots is not saved or loaded.  Also, because of the commodity GUID issue
above, accounts will not have the correct commodity.

TODO:

- Create DB tables if they don't exist
- gnc_numeric numerator/denominator are gint64, not int
- Better representation for gnc_numeric - doesn't compare well
- Map object->tables
- queries
- SQLite if just a "file"
- Fix commodity handling
- dates should be "date" not stored as string
- slots
- lots
- transactions/splits
- sched transactions
- check for memory leaks
