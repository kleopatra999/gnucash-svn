    - dispose: should no longer hold references to other objects; callable
      multiple times; chain up at end

      chain up at end.

Pedantic Todo
----------------------

- s/SchedXaction/Scheduled/
- s/temporal_state/instance_sequence_context/
- change instance variable from 'i' to '__i' or something

The since-last-run dialog is a key user interface.  More frequently than the
SX list or editor, the user will be in the process of creating transaction
instances through this interface.

The old SLR dialog has the following stages:

- Reminders
  - can be promoted to "to-create"
- Auto-created, with notification
- To-Create
  - postponed, to-create
  - ignore state.
- Created review
- Obsolete SX cleanup

The new SLR dialog will have the following:

- Creation
  (treemodel consisting of)
  - auto-created
  - reminder
  - postponed
  - to-create
  - [obsolete SX]?

There is no seperate to-review page, however the user may (optionally) want
to see the created transactions.  This is done using the transaction-search
functionality over the created transactions by ID.

Upcoming instance states
---------------------------------------

    reminder  -> to-create
    postponed -> to-create
    to-create -> postponed
    to-create -> ignore
    to-create -> created [terminal]

Definitions:

    reminder: a transient upcoming transaction that will not be created.
    postponed: a historical to-create transaction that the user has
        explicitly deferred.
    to-create: an upcoming SX instance that should be created.
    ignore: a scheduled instance the user has explicitly prevented the
        instantiation of.
    created: the instance has been created in this interaction cycle.

Formula Parsing
------------------------

A SXes formula is parsed in the context of:
- the template transaction
  - the accounts of the splits
- the sequence number
- the date of the transaction
- a variable-binding table.

Testing Notes
---------------------

- auto-create
  - auto-create with postponed instances shouldn't destroy postponed
    instances

- basic sequence stuff

dialog-sxsincelast.c:  ~L1241:
"Handle an interesting corner case of postponing or
ignoring the first instance. We only want to incrment the
counters for newly-discovered-as-to-be-created SXes."

- auto-create 
  - auto-create transactions can be created w/o user interaction
    - their state is transitioned to 'created', which is not modifyable
  
  - auto-create (+notify) transactions should be displayed, even if they are
    the only transactions created.
  
  - auto-create (-notify) transactions should not be displayed, unless there
    are other transactions.
  
  - Scenarios
    - only auto-create (-notify): no SLR, info dialog w/count (***)
    - only auto-create (+notify): SLR dialog, already created
    - others, auto-create (-notify): SLR dialog, incl. created 
    - others, auto-create (+notify): SLR dialog, incl. created
