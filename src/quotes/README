This directory contains assorted perl scripts.

gnc-restore.pl will read a gnucash log file and push the transactions 
    into a gnucash file.  Its rather raw and not guarenteed to work.

value_portfolio is a stand-alone perl script for updating and printing
    the value of a portfolio.  To use this script, edit the the first 
    few lines at the top of the file to indicate your portfolio and 
    purchase price.

update_prices is a stand-alone perl script  for updating the prices
    of stocks and mutual funds in a gnucash file. Its rather lame at the
    moment.

Finance::Quote
    This is a perl 5 module that will pull one or more stock and/or mutual
    fund quotes from a variety of sources, including Yahoo! Finance.
